    story:
      "The army commander called to several of the villagers and ordered them to separate the army/police family members and the Minbodan family members. The villagers intuitively sensed that those in the army/police family group would be spared, and began to move into groups. While some were successful in joining the army family group, most were prevented by the soldiers. Another villager, Han Kyeong-rim, was shot by a soldier when attempting to join the army/police family group. At this point the battalion commander arrived on the scene and the officers began to discuss what to do with the remaining villagers. According to a police officer, Kim Byeong-seok, who was driving the vehicle the officers were meeting in. One officer commented that the majority of the enlisted soldiers there had no experience 'killing the enemy', and that it would be good if they had a chance to build some experience. This suggestion was accepted.The soldiers began taking the villagers, group-by-group, either east to Dangpat field or west to Neobeunsoongi where they were shot and executed.",

    story:
      "The police went out and began arresting people. Upon being detained, people were given a rank of A, B, C, or D depending on their level of 'dangerousness'. In reality, these ranks were largely meaningless as offenses included things like having a family member who disappeared during the April 3 Incident or being drunk.Eventually the lower ranks of A and B were released. However people designated with the ranks of C and D were sentenced to death. The executions took place over two periods. The first people were executed sometime around July 16-20, 1950 and the rest were executed on August 20, 1950. In the end, 191 people from the Daejeong area were executed. An additional 63 people from the Hallim area were also killed.",

    story:
      "On December 18, 1948 suppression forces discovered a cave near Darangshi Oreum. After tossing a grenade into the cave they ordered those hiding in the cave to come out. The hiding Jeju residents though knew that coming out also almost assuredly meant certain death and did not respond. In response the suppression forces lit a fire in the cave's entrance and blocked off the entrance leaving the cave to fill with smoke, causing the people inside to suffocate to death.",
